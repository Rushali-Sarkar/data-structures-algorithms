The time complexity of the algorithm is O(log(n)) in average case but in case the Binary Search
Tree just has one big branch and no other branching then the time complexity will be O(n) which
is the worst case.

The space complexity of the algorithm will also be O(log(n)) as there are recursive calls and 
the calls are stored in the call stack and simillary in case there is no other branching 
the worst case space complexity will be O(n)
