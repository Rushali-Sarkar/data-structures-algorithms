The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) since we are calculating the value of each
nth term only once. It is calculated once and stored in the hash table and every time next
it is required it is being referenced from the hash table  in O(1) time.

The space complexity of this algorithm is however O(n). It is because, though there are no 
call stack involved for most part of the solution yet there is a hastable required to store 
all the n values of the fibonacci sequence.
