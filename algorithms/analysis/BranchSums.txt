The time complexity of the algorithms is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the binary
tree because all the nodes are traversed at least once.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n) because there is an array made of atmost n
elements. Because the number of  leaf nodes is almost the half the total number of nodes
in the tree. The call stack on the other hand has atmost one complete branch of the tree 
that is O(log(n)). Hence the space complexity is O(n).
