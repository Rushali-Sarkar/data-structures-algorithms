The space complexity of the solution is O(n) since everytimt the function is called,
it gets stored in the call stack until the next call and so on and so forth until the
base case is finally hit.

The time complexity for this soltuion is O(2 ^ n) since everytime the function is called,
there are two more function calls that has to be taken care of. In other words the calls
keep on increasing twice the no of calls for each time.
