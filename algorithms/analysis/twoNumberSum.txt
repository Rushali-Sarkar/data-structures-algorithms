The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) as the elements in the array is looked up only
once in the entire process. The find function in a hash table is O(1) so the overall time 
complexity remains O(n)

The space complexity is however O(n) because we are decalring a hash table and storing atmost
n values in it (worst case where no two numbers add up to the given result).
