The time complexity of this algorithm will be O(n) in worst case when there is no other 
branching but one single big branch in the tree, in average case however the time complexity
will be O(log(n)) beacause we will be eliminating one of the Binary Search Tree after each 
iteration.

The space complexity of this algorithm is however O(1) in all cases because there is no
extra space used as the input increases. The space used always remains a constant.
